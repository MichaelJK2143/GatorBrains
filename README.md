# GatorBrains
### Created by Team Brainiacs
This website was created in order to connect students studying similar courses and facilitate collaborative study sessions while fostering a supportive learning community. By providing a platform for users to find peers studying the same subjects, our goal was to enhance study efficiency, encourage knowledge sharing, and promote academic success.

With our platform, you'll be able to easily connect with peers and classmates studying in Marston to enhance both of your study sessions and improve your academic performance. Say goodbye to solo study sessions and hello to collaborative learning opportunities, tailored to your course needs.

## Dependencies
Tools: Next.js, Docker, Flask, SQLAlchemy, NextUI, TailWindCSS, React
You will need to have Python and JavaScript installed.
But a decent majority of this will be automatically installed when the Requirements.txt is ran with the build.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download Docker and Node.js
2. Run Docker build and Docker run in order for the Backend to run
3. Run the command in the Frontend file 'npm run dev'
4. If no Frontend page pops up, type in the URL 'localhost:3000'

## Usage 
1. You’ll begin by creating a username and password. After that, you will see a layout of a Marston of your choosing.
2. You can then hover your mouse over the map, and then select the location on the map where you are going to study. 
3. Click the desired location and a red dot will appear asking for a course _____. Make sure what you enter is the courses code!!! Or something less than or equal to 8 characters (so you can say something like MCAT too). 
4. Your study session has started! Now others can see where and what you are studying, and choose to join your session too.
5. Exiting out of the website will end all of the study sessions.

## Some other cool features:
- **Start time:** you can see the time a study group was initially created and be in awe of how long they’ve been studying
- **Members:** when you click on an active study session, you can see a list of the members who have joined that session.  

## Reflection and Future Goals
This was everyone in the team's first hackathon, so we ran into a lot of problems both technically and as a programming team.
But hopefully we'll be able to do work together in the future to improve it and launch it as an actual website for students to use.
Here's a little rundown of what we'd change:
- Resolve all the issues with our current implementation.
- Finish developing the *Active User* tab that will display all of the Users currently studying on a selected floor.
- Add the option to leave the study group, rather than leaving when the browser is closed. This would remove that user from the Study Session's Members list, and once that list is empty, the Study Session will end on its own.
- Include Library West as an option.
- Improve the UI/UX.
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
